# I like to use IntelliJ and prefer Java for doing and practising coding/DSA/learning. Here is my template of Java classes and methods that I use for practising/competing on LeetCode, InterviewBit, CodeChef, Codeforces.

**If anyone wishes or like to add his/her own template/boilerplate, or make some change/add method or class, feel free to send pull request.**
